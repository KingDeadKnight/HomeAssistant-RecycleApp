Integrate [RecycleApp](https://recycleapp.be/) into your Home Assistant.

## Installation
At this point the integration is not part of the default HACS repositories, so
you will need to add this repository as a custom repository in HACS.

When this is done, just install the repository.

The configuration happens in the configuration flow when you add the integration.
